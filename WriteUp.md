Downloaded Conda on linux in order to have multiple environments.
Downloded Isaac Sim and Lab on linux.
SSH'ed into the Linux computer using my Mac in order to access Isaac Lab, however still cannot see the GUI.Attempted to use IsaacSim WebRTC however couldn't get it to work, will revist later. 
Used XQuarts in order to see the GUI of IsaacLab. It is significantly slower with a bad framerate, but it works. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdXDMIvQuTs
Ran IsaacLabs Cartpole RL code and got it to work.
Visualized the log information of the 150 cartpole epochs using tensorboard. 

NextUp: Familiarize with IsaacLab code and documentation, and implementing PD Control on Unitree Go2 Robot.
